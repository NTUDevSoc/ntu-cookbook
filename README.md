Looking for a place that stores all kinds of student recipes? Well you've found it! This is an open source project started by one of our members, [**Jordan**](https://github.com/jordanofoster). The project is inspired by [**LukeSmithxyz's**](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/based.cooking) project.  

The purpose of this project and repo is to compile various cooking recipes, methodologies and techniques from students at Nottingham Trent University. This repository is maintained and supported by members of [**NTU DevSoc**](https://devsoc.co.uk/). 

### Interested in Contributing?

If you're using github, make sure to check ![CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NTUDevSoc/ntu-cookbook/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're not technically inclined, you can still contribute by writing your recipe into a form at `PUT FORM DOMAIN HERE` - we will be able to take it from there and implement it into the site.

### How do I use this?

The easiest way to access this is through our *github pages* website: https://cooking.devsoc.dev, where you can navigate through the recipes people have contributed as you would any other website.

If you'd like to keep these websites locally accessible, you have a few options; A webpage can be printed by pressing *CTRL+P* on your browser, or you can download the individual recipes by clicking the *Download ZIP* option in the github repository, like so;
